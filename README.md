*A repository of helpful resources for learning to use Git!*

## Tutorials/Lessons

[McMaster DASH Tutorial on GitHub and GitHub Pages](https://scds.github.io/github-pages/)<br>
Our very own Jay Brodeur has created a nice walkthrough on getting started with GitHub, and using GH "Pages" to create a webpage.

[Learning Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)<br>
An interactive web tutorial that introduces the jargon of Git, and basic Git bash commands, in a friendly, colourful, graphical format.

[Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/)<br>
Learn to integrate Git with RStudio. A tutorial developed and maintained by Jenny Bryan et al (UBC) to introduce stats students to Git.

## Bash Language References
*If you want to use Git from command line, but you're new to the Bash shell, here are some language references to help you get started!*

[Git Commands Reference Manual](https://git-scm.com/docs)<br>
A "cheatsheet" for Git-specific Bash commands. Keep this handy.

[An A-Z Index of the Linux command line: bash + utilities](https://ss64.com/bash/)<br>
A "cheatsheet" for basic Bash commands. Keep this handy.

[Bash Commands Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)<br>
For really getting into the weeds of built-in commands and features of the Bash shell. This is a big document, I recommend `ctrl+F` if you know what you're looking for!

## Textbooks

[Pro Git v2 (Chacon and Straub, 2014)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)<br>

Likely too much for beginners, but highly recommended as a comprehensive resource. They go straight to Git bash commands, as they feel it's better to start in the shell and then try a Git client (e.g. GitKraken, SourceTree).
